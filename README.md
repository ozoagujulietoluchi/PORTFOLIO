![image](https://github.com/ozoagujulietoluchi/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/AGBAGBO%20IMMUNIZATION%20COVERAGE%20DASHBOARD.png)

This report presents a monitoring and evaluation analysis of the immunization coverage in 
Agbagbo Awha Imezi, focusing on vaccination numbers, missed appointments, and stock-out 
days among 0-18 years children who received immunization at Agbagbo Awha Imezi PHC in 
Ezeagu LGA in Enugu State for two months (January and February). With a total of 9,370 
individuals vaccinated, the average immunization coverage rate stood at 97%. Despite this 
high coverage, the data reveals several challenges, such as significant vaccine stock-out days of 
12, high missed appointments of 250, and regional disparities in service delivery. These 
insights call for strategic improvements in logistics, communication (sensitization) and regional 
engagement.

HealthCare Departmental Report

![image](https://github.com/ozoagujulietoluchi/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/performance%20of%20health%20department.png)

This analysis evaluates the performance of Agbagbo Awha Imezi PHC in Ezeagu LGA between 
the month of January to May 2023, with a total of 4,251 patients volume which were attended to 
by 304 healthcare staff across 10 departments, resulting in an average patient-to-staff ratio of 
14:1, average wait time of 75.5 minutes, and average data entry time of 7 minutes. The 
Emergency Department recorded the highest patient volume at 589 patients per day but also 
had the worst patient-to-staff ratio (20:1) and a high wait time of 89.0 minutes, indicating 
severe strain on resources. Conversely, Radiology had the lowest patient volume (303) and the 
best staff ratio (9:1), making it a model for resource efficiency. The Orthopedics department 
reported the longest average wait time of 98.8 minutes, despite moderate patient volume, 
pointing to systemic inefficiencies, while Maternity had the shortest wait time (60 minutes). 
Dermatology and ENT showed the fastest data entry turnaround (4 minutes), while  
Orthopedics and Surgery lagged behind with 9 minutes. A notable anomaly occurred in April, 
where wait times increased across multiple departments
