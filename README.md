Agbagbo Awha Imezi, focusing on vaccination numbers, missed appointments, and stock-out

Ezeagu LGA in Enugu State for two months (January and February). With a total of 9,370

12, high missed appointments of 250, and regional disparities in service delivery. These 
insights call for strategic improvements in logistics, communication (sensitization) and regional 
engagement.
